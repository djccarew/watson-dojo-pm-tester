## Step 3 - Watson Machine Learning Service Instance has no credentials

After creating the Watson Machine Learning Service Instance, it should create a set of credentials automatically. If it does not, you will experience a 500 error when adding the Machine Learning service as an associated service in DSX (Step 5).

![ML Error][1]

As a workaround, go to your IBM Cloud Dashboard, click the Watson Machine Learning service. Click "Service credentials".

Click the "New credential" button. give it a name or use the autopopulated one and click add. Expand "View credentials" and take note of your user name and password. You will need to enter this into DSX in Step 6.
