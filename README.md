# Create and deploy a scoring model to predict heart failure on IBM Cloud with the Watson Data Platform

> Data Science Experience is now Watson Studio. Although some images in this code pattern may show the service as Data Science Experience, the steps and processes will still work.

In this Code Pattern, we will use a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio to build a predictive model that demonstrates a potential health care use case.
This a customized version of the Node.js sample app that is available with the [Watson Machine Learning Service on IBM Cloud](http://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/PredictiveModeling/index.html).
See the [original app](https://github.com/pmservice/predictive-modeling-samples) for a walkthrough of the source code.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a predictive model within a Jupyter Notebook
* Deploy the model to IBM Watson Machine Learning service
* Access the Machine Learning model via either APIs or a Nodejs app

## Flow
1. The developer creates an IBM Watson Studio Workspace.
2. IBM Watson Studio depends on an Apache Spark service.
3. IBM Watson Studio uses Cloud Object storage to manage your data.
4. This lab is built around a Jupyter Notebook, this is where the developer will import data, train, and evaluate their model.
5. Import data on heart failure.
6. Trained models are deployed into production using IBM's Watson Machine Learning Service.
7. A Node.js web app is deployed on IBM Cloud calling the predictive model hosted in the Watson Machine Learning Service.
8. A user visits the web app, enters their information, and the predictive model returns a response.
